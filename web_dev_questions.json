            "text": "A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer (enclosing) lexical scope, even after the outer function has returned. Closures are created every time a function is created and enable data privacy and factory functions."

            "text": "Promises represent asynchronous operations that can be pending, fulfilled, or rejected. async/await is syntactic sugar over promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous. async functions return promises, and await pauses execution until the promise resolves."
